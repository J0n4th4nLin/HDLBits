# HDLBits
### Just record my practices   
1. I study by myself, so I just wanna record my learning process. I code on HDLBits I also recode on VS Code include module to endmodule not only main code.  
2. Therefore my record is except the answer, I also write some note which I got problems during recode. Suitable for beginner or study by yourself as me.   
3. Although my solution is not necessarily the best, and there maybe had another better answer on the net, but my all codes can work on HDLBits.  
4. I'll update my answer from time to time, and I expect to complete all practices in Feb, 2023.  

Hope to help everyone.
